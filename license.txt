-- BEGIN LICENCE --

Unless specifically authorized in writing by the author of this
library, you are given a limited license to use and distributed
this library and software incorporating elements of this library
in accordance with the following conditions:

  1. WARRANTIES AND SUITABILITY TO TASK

  This library comes with no warranties at all, either expressed
  or implied. This includes such warranties as merchantability
  or fitness for a particular purpose. There is no guarantee
  whatsoever that this library will perform as per expected and
  described operation.

  2. COST RECOVERY

  Except to recover reasonable costs for media and distribution
  purposes, monies or payment in any form whatsoever for this
  library or creations incorporating any element of this library
  may not be made.

  3. MODIFICATION AND/OR DISTRIBUTION

  You many not modify and/or distribute modified copies of this
  library or provide mechanisms for creating modified versions
  of this library without prior consent of the author. You may,
  however, for the purposes of integration and development of
  software using elements of this library make minimal and
  reasonable changes to ensure this library will compile on an
  otherwise incompatible operating system. These modifications
  must not change the functionality of the library and must
  interoperate with existing unmodified versions of this
  library.

  4. COPYRIGHT AND CREATION NOTICES

  Any software incorporating or using elements of this library
  must ensure that notice is placed in such software or
  accompanying documentation so as to give credit to the
  authorship, copyright ownership and current version of this
  library.

  5. NOTIFICATION OF USE

  Reasonable attempts must be made to notify the author of this
  library of the existence and generation of any software that
  incorporates elements of this library. Further, reasonable
  attempts must be made to provide the author with a copy of
  such software.


-- END LICENSE --


A rough english-speak translation of the above is as such (this
does not constitute part of the license, but merely attempts to
explain it):

  Unless I specifically say so, all the following holds. Which
  means I may of course relax any or all of the following
  restrictions or modify them on request.

  This library is free, and you are allowed to use it for free
  providing you or someone isn't going to make any money out of
  it. Shareware or commercial use maybe considered upon
  application to the author. At the same time, this library is
  centrally controlled in terms of modifications and future
  revisions. This means that only I as the author can release
  new versions of any form, though you are welcome to submit
  patches or improvements to me. This means you are not allowed
  to distribute modified copies of this library or software to
  generate modified copies of this library.

  I do this to prevent splinters in the source tree, and to
  maintain compatibility. I do allow the distribution of patches
  that fix existing bugs or incompatibilities with particular
  operating systems, provided the patches don't change the way
  the library operates and don't stop it interoperating with
  unmodified versions of the library.

  I also ask that you make best efforts to send me, or notify me
  about how to retrieve a copy of any software which uses this
  library. The reason I ask this is that feedback of this sort
  is important in determining modifications and future
  directions of the library. By the same token, I welcome any
  _constructive_ criticisms, comments and suggestions.
