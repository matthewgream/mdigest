 *  -- mgream: endian definitions not needed, they are computed run time
 *  -- mgream: changed prototypes from ansi (for compat)
 *
 *  havalapp.h:  specifies the following three constants needed to
 *               compile the HAVAL hashing library:
 *                     LITTLE_ENDIAN, PASS and FPTLEN
 *
 *  Descriptions:
 *
 *   LITTLE_ENDIAN  define this only if your machine is little-endian
 *                  (such as 80X86 family). 
 *
 *         Note:
 *            1. In general, HAVAL is faster on a little endian
 *               machine than on a big endian one.
 *
 *            2. The test program "havaltest.c" provides an option
 *               for testing the endianity of your machine.
 *
 *            3. The speed of HAVAL is even more remarkable on a
 *               machine that has a large number of internal registers.
 *
 *   PASS     define the number of passes        (3, 4, or 5)
 *   FPTLEN   define the length of a fingerprint (128, 160, 192, 224 or 256)

/*
 *  haval.h:  specifies the interface to the HAVAL (V.1) hashing library.
 *
 *      HAVAL is a one-way hashing algorithm with the following
 *      collision-resistant property:
 *             It is computationally infeasible to find two or more
 *             messages that are hashed into the same fingerprint.

 *       length of output'', Advances in Cryptology --- AUSCRYPT'92,
 *       Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, 1993.
 *
 *      This library provides routines to hash
 *        -  a string,

 *        -  a 32-word block, and
 *        -  a string of specified length.
